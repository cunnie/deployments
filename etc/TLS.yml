# This manifest operations file is intended for BOSH directors that are
# deployed with certificates issued by a recognized CA (e.g. Let's Encrypt,
# Verisign, Comodo) and who are deploying their BOSH director with UAA and
# CredHub

# I don't want auto-generated certificates -- I spent $100 for a wildcard
# certificate, and gosh-darn I plan to use it (*.nono.io)

# The following is for BOSH directors deployed with UAA & CredHub. Note that
# these operations require the variable `external_fqdn`, which should be set to
# something similar to `bosh-gce.nono.io`. Its IP address should match either
# the external or internal IP (in our case, it's our external IP address)

# We need to set the URL to an FQDN instead of an IP address because commercial
# CAs issue their certificates for FQDNs, but never for IP addresses, so our
# BOSH director's services must be configured to query the FQDN when important.
# We don't need to do this for all services; merely the ones that we interact
# with via the CLI (i.e. ports 25555, 8443).
